# Text Clustering
 
In this project, three unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used:
1. K-means clustering
2. Hierarchical clustering 
3. Expectation Maximization clustering

These algorithms cluster the text data taken from five different books with different genres for semantic analysis and different authors of Gutenberg digital books.
The overall objective is to produce clustering predictions and compare them; analyze the pros and cons of algorithms, use coherence coefficient, kappa analysis, silhouette score to evaluate the models and choose the best one.
